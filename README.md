# COVID-cases-per-capita-prediction-
Designed a multiple regression linear model to predict COVID cases per capita of different U.S. counties; with report detailing model construction and analyzation
Though some EDA exploration are guided, I aim to increase our originality and social impact by drifting away from staff's requirement for
our model construction and data importation process. 
The project is collaborated with Ziyi Ding and Derrick Sun.
